# Blackbox Exporter Removal Summary

## What was removed:

### 1. Docker Compose Service
- Removed `blackbox-exporter` service from `docker-compose.yml`
- Removed port mapping `9115:9115`
- Removed volume mount for blackbox configuration

### 2. Configuration Files
- Deleted `blackbox.yml` configuration file

### 3. Prometheus Configuration
- Removed `blackbox` scrape job from `prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- Removed `blackbox-exporter` scrape job from `prometheus/prometheus.yml`
- Removed blackbox targets:
  - `http://host.docker.internal:3000/health`
  - `http://host.docker.internal:8080`
  - `http://localhost:9090/-/healthy`

### 4. Alert Rules
- Removed `HTTPProbeFailed` alert rule
- Removed `HighResponseTime` alert rule
- Removed `LowUptimePercentage` alert rule
- Removed `NotrusAPIHealthCheckFailed` alert rule

## Remaining Services:
- âœ… Prometheus (metrics collection)
- âœ… Grafana (visualization)
- âœ… AlertManager (alert routing)
- âœ… PostgreSQL (database)
- âœ… RabbitMQ (message broker)
- âœ… Redis (cache)
- âœ… Prometheus Aggregation Gateway

## Impact:
- **Lost functionality**: HTTP endpoint monitoring and probing
- **Retained functionality**: All other monitoring capabilities remain intact
- **Benefits**: Simplified stack, fewer moving parts, reduced resource usage

## Alternative monitoring:
If you need HTTP endpoint monitoring later, you can:
1. Add application-level health checks
2. Use Prometheus HTTP probes in scrape configs
3. Implement custom health check endpoints
4. Re-add blackbox exporter if needed

The monitoring stack is now simpler and more focused on your core services! ðŸš€
